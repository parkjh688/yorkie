## How to contribute

Yorkie is Apache 2.0 licensed and accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests
. This document outlines some of the conventions on commit message formatting,
contact points for developers, and other resources to help get contributions
into Yorkie.

### Contacts

If you have any questions along the way, please donâ€™t hesitate to ask us
- Slack: [Dev Yorkie](https://dev-yorkie.slack.com/): You can sign up for our
 [Slack here](https://communityinviter.com/apps/dev-yorkie/yorkie-framework).

### Getting started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Read the README.md for build instructions

## Contribution flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where to base the contribution (usually main).
- Make commits of logical units.
- Make sure commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
- Push changes in a topic branch to a personal fork of the repository.
- Make sure all tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
- Submit a pull request to the original repository.
- The PR must receive a LGTM from maintainers.

Thanks for contributing!

### Code style

The coding style suggested by the Golang community is used in Yorkie. See the
[style doc](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) for details.
And we recommended referring to
[Uber Go Style Guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md).

### Format of the commit message

We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer two
questions: what changed and why. The subject line should feature the what and
the body of the commit should describe the why.

```
Remove the synced seq when detaching the document

To collect garbage like CRDT tombstones left on the document, all
the changes should be applied to other replicas before GC. For this
, if the document is no longer used by this client, it should be
detached.
```

The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the
second line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters.
This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git
tools.

### Testing

Testing is the responsibility of all contributors, but it is also coordinated by
maintainers. It is recommended to write them in order from successful cases to
exceptional cases.

There are multiple types of tests. The location of the test code varies with
type, as do the specifics of the environment needed to successfully run the test:

- Unit: These confirm that a particular function behaves as intended. 
- Integration: These tests cover interactions of package components or
 interactions between Yorkie packages and some other non-Yorkie system resource
  (eg: MongoDB, ETCD).
- Stress: These confirm that the performance of the implemented function.
